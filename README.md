This is a demo project to highlight how I would conduct a Data Science Project for a electric car company. For this project I have chosen General Motors as they are an emerging choice for consumers who want to buy an electric car
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Status of project: Ongoing (Still collecting, manipulating and cleaning data for accurate readings)

# Online Marketing Effectiveness Overview

By using digital marketing methods, marketers can now better measure and analyze their efforts. Today’s marketers can track every action prospects and customers take and determine their level of interest. Marketing teams rely on real-time data to see which approaches are working and which are not. At the same time, marketers must make sure that the data they have is accurate and reliable. The better the data, the better decisions and adjustments they can make in the course of a campaign.

     • Business understanding
    
   This entails the understanding of a project’s objectives and requirements from the business viewpoint. Such business perspectives are used to figure out what business problems to solve via the use of data mining.
 
     • Data understanding
 
   This phase allows us to become familiarize with the data and this involves performing exploratory data analysis. Such initial data exploration may allow us to figure out which subsets of data to use for further modeling as well as aid in the generation of hypothesis to explore.
 
     • Data preparation
 
   This can be considered to be the most time-consuming phase of the data mining process as it involves rigorous data cleaning and pre-processing as well as the handling of missing data.
 
     • Modelling
 
   The pre-processed data are used for model building in which learning algorithms are used to perform multivariate analysis.
 
     • Evaluation
 
   In performing the 4 aforementioned steps, it is important to evaluate the accrued results and review the process performed thusfar to determine whether the originally set business objectives are met or not. If deemed appropriate, some steps may need to be performed again. Rinse and repeat. Once it is deemed that the results and process are satisfactory then we are ready to move to deployment. Additionally, in this evaluation phase, some findings may ignite new project ideas for which to explore.
 
    • Deployment
 
   Once the model is of satisfactory quality, the model is then deployed, which may range from being a simple report, an API that can be accessed via programmatic calls, a web application, etc.
